Docker Compose Small Projects Repository

This repository is dedicated to small projects that are containerized using Docker Compose. Each project is designed to showcase the use of Docker Compose for orchestrating and managing multi-container applications. These projects provide examples and best practices for deploying and scaling applications with Docker Compose. Feel free to explore the projects, learn from the code, and use them as a reference for your own projects.

Project Structure

The repository follows a consistent structure to ensure clarity and ease of navigation. Each project is contained within its own directory and consists of the following files and directories:

1. `docker-compose.yml` - This file defines the services and their configurations for the project. It specifies the containers, networking, volumes, and other dependencies required to run the application.

2. `Dockerfile` - This file contains the instructions for building the Docker image of the application. It includes the necessary dependencies, environment variables, and commands to set up the application within the container.

3. `app` - This directory contains the application code and any additional files or directories required by the project.

4. `README.md` - This file provides a detailed description of the project, including its purpose, features, and usage instructions. It may also include any additional information that may be relevant to the project.

Getting Started

To get started with a specific project, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the corresponding README.md file. The README.md file contains detailed information about the project, including prerequisites, installation instructions, and usage examples.

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system before attempting to run the projects. You can find more information about installing Docker and Docker Compose from the official documentation: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
